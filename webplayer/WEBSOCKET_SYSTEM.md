# WebSocket and Command System Documentation

## 1. WebSocket Connection Management

- **Connection Stability**
  - Removed unnecessary WebSocket closures during playlist transitions
  - Added `isPlaylistTransitioning` flag for better state tracking
  - Enhanced connection health monitoring
  - Improved reconnection logic with exponential backoff

- **State Tracking**
  - Added detailed logging for WebSocket state changes
  - Improved closure event logging with stack traces
  - Better connection state management
  - Enhanced error recovery mechanisms

## 2. Command Handling

- **Command Queue**
  - Set `COMMAND_TIMEOUT` to 0 (no expiration)
  - Commands remain in queue until processed
  - Improved queue processing logic
  - Better handling of command priorities

- **Navigation Commands**
  - Enhanced 'next' and 'prev' command handling
  - Improved montage navigation logic
  - Better state management during transitions
  - Added comprehensive logging

## 3. Navigation Logic

- **Previous Montage Navigation**
  - Time-based navigation rules:
    - First 5 seconds: goes to previous montage
    - After 5 seconds: goes to start of current montage
  - Improved position tracking
  - Enhanced transition handling
  - Better error recovery

- **State Management**
  - Added state consistency checks
  - Improved error handling
  - Better resource cleanup
  - Enhanced logging system

## 4. Debug Tools

### 4.1 `checkState`

```javascript
checkState: () => {
  console.log('[DEBUG] WsTools state:', {
    wsExists: !!this.ws,
    wsReadyState: this.ws?.readyState,
    wsUrl: this.ws?.url,
    isConnecting: this.isConnecting,
    wsState: this.wsState,
    httpPingTimer: !!this.httpPingTimer,
    httpPingsSent: this.httpPingsSent,
    httpPingsSuccessful: this.httpPingsSuccessful,
    lastHttpPingTime: this.lastHttpPingTime,
    HTTP_PING_URL: this.HTTP_PING_URL,
  });
};
```

**Purpose**: Provides a comprehensive snapshot of the WebSocket connection state

- Shows if WebSocket exists and its ready state
- Displays connection status and URL
- Shows HTTP ping statistics
- Useful for diagnosing connection issues

### 4.2 `forceSetup`

```javascript
forceSetup: () => {
  console.log('[DEBUG] Force calling setupWebSocket...');
  this.setupWebSocket();
};
```

**Purpose**: Forces a new WebSocket connection setup

- Useful when connection is stuck or in a bad state
- Can be used to manually trigger reconnection
- Helps in testing connection recovery

### 4.3 `checkHttpPing`

```javascript
checkHttpPing: () => {
  console.log('[DEBUG] HTTP Ping Status:', {
    pingsSent: this.httpPingsSent,
    pingsSuccessful: this.httpPingsSuccessful,
    lastPingTime: this.lastHttpPingTime,
    lastPingResponse: this.lastHttpPingResponse,
    pingTimer: !!this.httpPingTimer,
  });
};
```

**Purpose**: Monitors HTTP ping health checks

- Shows ping success/failure statistics
- Displays timing information
- Helps diagnose connection stability issues
- Useful for monitoring connection health

### 4.4 `checkConnectionHealth`

```javascript
checkConnectionHealth: () => {
  console.log('[DEBUG] Connection Health:', {
    connectionState: this.connectionState,
    isConnecting: this.isConnecting,
    wsState: this.wsState,
    isRegistrationComplete: this.isRegistrationComplete,
    lastMessageReceived: this.lastMessageReceived,
    connectionDuration: Date.now() - this.connectionStartTime,
  });
};
```

**Purpose**: Provides detailed connection health information

- Shows current connection state
- Displays registration status
- Shows message activity
- Helps track connection duration
- Useful for monitoring overall connection health

## 5. Usage Examples

```javascript
// Access debug tools in browser console
window.debugWsTools.checkState();
window.debugWsTools.forceSetup();
window.debugWsTools.checkHttpPing();
window.debugWsTools.checkConnectionHealth();
```
