# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## ✅ Repository Ready!

Your local git repository is initialized and committed. Now let's push it to GitHub.

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to **https://github.com/new**
2. Repository name: **`wallmuse-digital-exhibitions`**
3. Description: *"Next-generation platform for creating and displaying digital exhibitions - WordPress plugin for museums, galleries, and cultural institutions"*
4. **Public** repository (for open source)
5. **Do NOT initialize** with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you instructions. Use these commands:

```bash
cd "/Users/alexandrekhan/react/play C 3/play/github-repo"

# Add GitHub as remote origin (replace YOUR-USERNAME with your actual GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/wallmuse-digital-exhibitions.git

# Rename branch to main (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify Upload

After pushing, go to:
**https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/wallmuse-digital-exhibitions**

You should see:

```

### 3. Create CONTRIBUTING.md
Guide for contributors on how to contribute to the project.

### 4. Set Up GitHub Actions (Optional)
Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for:
- Automated testing
- Build verification
- Deployment automation

### 5. Announce Release
- Share on social media
- Post to relevant WordPress forums
- Submit to WordPress plugin directory (when ready)

## WordPress Plugin Directory Submission

When ready to submit to wordpress.org/plugins:

1. **Prepare plugin structure:**
   - Create main plugin file with proper headers
   - Add `readme.txt` in WordPress format
   - Ensure GPL-compatible license
   - Add screenshots
   - Test on fresh WordPress install

2. **Submit to WordPress.org:**
   - Go to https://wordpress.org/plugins/developers/add/
   - Submit your plugin for review
   - Respond to review feedback
   - Once approved, SVN repository will be created

## Support & Maintenance

Remember to:
- ✅ Respond to GitHub Issues
- ✅ Review Pull Requests
- ✅ Update documentation
- ✅ Tag releases properly
- ✅ Maintain changelog

## Troubleshooting

### "Remote already exists"
```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/wallmuse-digital-exhibitions.git
```

### Authentication Issues
If using HTTPS and prompted for password:
- Use Personal Access Token instead of password
- Or set up SSH keys for easier authentication

### Large Files
If you get "file too large" errors:
- Check `.gitignore` is excluding `node_modules/` and `build/`
- Use Git LFS for large media files
